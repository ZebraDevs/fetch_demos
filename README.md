Fetch Robot Demonstrations and example ROS packages

:construction:
**Warning** These demos are the result of _intern_ projects. 

The working state of the intern projects is not guarenteed. They worked at least once.

**Fetch Robotics** has internships available year round [apply here](https://fetchrobotics.com/become-a-fetcher/). Interns work on a variety of projects, past projects include:

1. https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_grasp_suggestion
2. https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_pbd

The goal of this demos repository is to keep intern project demos grouped together to prevent future interns from reinventing the wheel, and to provide students and researchers in labs some useful demonstration and example code.
